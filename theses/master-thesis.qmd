We show that quality-competition among private firms in the Swedish primary
care have worsened during the last 15 years. As a result, public funds turn
into profits, rather than quality care for patients. Our interpretation is that
providers have not increased their (cost of) quality at the same rate as the
compensation has increased. We measure the intensity of quality-competition
with markups, which we retrieve from a production function, as De Loecker and
Warzynski (2012). Since this is the first application of this methodology to
estimate quality competition, we adapt the method by including quality in the
Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2015) two-stage estimator to control for
time-variant unobserved firm quality and productivity.
