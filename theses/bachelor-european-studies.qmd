This Bachelor thesis’s purpose was to clarify recent questions on the euro
effect, the effect that says that two countries who share the euro will trade
more with each other, compared to countries that do not share the euro. Some
authors have suggested that the euro effect in recent years has been
significantly weaker than earlier studies have suggested. In recent years most
studies conducted have used different types of simulation models to assess the
effects of the euro, however this thesis uses the gravity model. The results
are that the euro effect probably is stronger than ever.
