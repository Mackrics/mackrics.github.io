# Hello there,
I am an quantitative analyst within competition economics. I enjoy solving 
quantitative problems and automating "boring tasks" using my in-depth knowledge 
of statistical programming languages (primarily [R](https://www.r-project.org/))
and other open source tools such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/), 
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and shell scripting.
