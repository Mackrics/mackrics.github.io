title: About
---

I am an quantitative analyst who give clients advice based on analyzes related to
competition economics. I enjoy solving quantitative problems and automating
"boring tasks" using my in-depth knowledge of statistical programming languages 
(primarily [R](https://www.r-project.org/)) and other open source tools such as
[Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and shell scripting.

I have a Master's degree in economics, where the thesis I co-authored about
competition in the Swedish primary care sector [received an award by the
Swedish Competition Authority](./blog/sca-award.qmd). During my studies, I took
courses within applied microeconomics, industrial organization, econometrics,
and statistical programming, which gave me an in-depth theoretical
understanding of markets and the quantitative tools used to analyze them.
