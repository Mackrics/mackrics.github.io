# About
I am an quantitative analyst who give clients advice based on analyzes related to
competition economics. I enjoy solving quantitative problems and automating
"boring tasks" using my in-depth knowledge of statistical programming languages 
(primarily [R](https://www.r-project.org/)) and other open source tools such as
[Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and shell scripting.
