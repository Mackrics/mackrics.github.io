# Hello there,
I am an quantitative analyst within competition economics. I enjoy solving 
quantitative problems and automating "boring tasks" using my in-depth knowledge 
of statistical programming languages (primarily [R](https://www.r-project.org/))
and other open source tools such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/), 
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and shell scripting.

I enjoy working on small side project to learn more about programming, such as:

- [Ricethemes](https://github.com/Mackrics/ricethemes): an R package with cool ggplot2 themes.
- [Neoslime](https://github.com/Mackrics/neoslime): a neovim plugin to send code from the editor to a nvim terminal
