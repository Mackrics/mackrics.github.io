I am an quantitative analyst at Copenhagen Economics, where I help clients
with quantitative analyses related to competition economics. I enjoy
solving complex quantitative problems creatively, where I am able to
leverage my in-depth knowledge of statistical programming languages.

Prior to joining Copenhagen Economics, I obtained Bachelor degrees in
both Economics and European Studies, and a Masters degree in Economics from
the University of Gothenburg. I specialize in applied	microeconomics and
econometrics, more specifically empirical industrial organization.
