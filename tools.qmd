title: "Software I Use"
---

## R
I use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) professionally in my daily work, but I
have also obtained advanced knowledge of R via an advanced course in R,
personal projects, and reading various books from [The Big Book of
R](https://www.bigbookofr.com/).

## Git
I am experienced using [Git](https://git-scm.com) for professional, academic,
and personal projects. I primarily use the [Pro
Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book for learning more about Git.

## Quarto
I am skilled using [quarto](https://quarto.org/). I have used quarto to create 
websites, books, reports, and presentations. By combining my strengths in Git,
R, shell, I am able to rapidly communicate results with great accuracy.

## Shell
I prefer to manage most things via the command line. When working on machines
running windows, I use Powershell. For Linux machines, I have experience with
bash, fish, but currently use [mksh](http://www.mirbsd.org/mksh.htm).
