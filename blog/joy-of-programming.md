During the 80's and 90's there was a popular television show called "the joy
of painting" by Bob Ross. If you have not heard about the show, you have almost
certainly seen some of the internet memes.

The videos of Bob Ross are entertaining and relaxing, Bob's light-hearted
approach to painting and his approach to learning something new is something
we as programming should adapt.

Bob's painting tutorials were never really advanced -- the shows are typically
30 minutes of him casually walking through some landscape painting.

The approach to learning programming is often that it should be directly
applicable to work and needs to be something new. Why would you ever re-write a
program that already exist? In a certain sense, there is no need to re-write
a program that you can already use.

There is an inherent joy in writing a program. Sometimes you have some extra
time and stumble upon a small issue in computing. One could spend a few minutes
to find a program that does what you want. An alternative is to try to write a 
very simple custom-built program to solve your small issue. The idea is not
to publish this program -- this is only something you do for yourself.
