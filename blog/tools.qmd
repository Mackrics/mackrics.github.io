## R
I use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) professionally in my daily work, but I
have also obtained advanced knowledge of R via an advanced course in R,
personal projects, and reading various books from [The Big Book of
R](https://www.bigbookofr.com/).

Specifically, I have used R to:

- Conduct econometric estimations such as:
  [OLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares),
  [GMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_method_of_moments), 
  [Instrument variables estimations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variables_estimation),
  and [Merger simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merger_simulation).
- Manage complex data structures by working with nested data.
- Clean data.
- Create interactive command line interface applications to speed up manual
  tasks and learn new concepts.
- Working with various application programming interface to automate workflows.


## Git
I am experienced using [Git](https://git-scm.com) for professional, academic,
and personal projects. I primarily use the [Pro
Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book for learning more about Git. Since I
prefer managing most things via a command line interface, and also use Git at
the command line, I am able to complete more advanced git tasks rapidly.

## Quarto
I am skilled using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to create reports,
presentations, websites, and books. Quarto enables me to automate tasks to
speed up the writing process and develop more reproducible reports.

## Shell
I prefer to manage most things via the command line. I use GNU/Linux on my
personal machines and have used a wide variety of shells such as bash, fish,
and mksh on them. I have also some experience using PowerShell on Windows
machines. I use shell to manage files, script smaller repetitive tasks, and
for smaller data exploration tasks.
