Why do you start a blog in 2023?

I decided that I really wanted to master [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and
learn some of its cooler features. One of the nice things you can create
with Quarto are different types of websites, such as a blog, to share technical 
content. 

Technical writing is difficult, and is something I want to improve at. To practice
technical writing, I decided to create a blog using Quarto and document some of
the stuff I learn and share my personal projects. Hopefully, my technical
writing will improve with practice.

The website is hosted via [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), and you can check out the source
code of this website in [this repository](https://github.com/Mackrics/mackrics.github.io).
