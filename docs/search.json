    "text": "Why would anyone start a blog in 2023?\nTechnical writing is difficult, and is something I want to improve at, which is why I’m starting a blog to practice my technical writing. I plan to share some of my personal project and stuff I learn from those projects on this blog, which I created with Quarto.\nQuarto is a very cool scientific typesetting system built to share technical content and share via, for example, a website such as this one. I built this website using Quarto as a personal project to learn more about how it works and to improve my web development skills. If you’re interested in how this website was created, I host it in a GitHub repository and publish it via GitHub pages. If you’re interested in creating a blog using Quarto, you can learn more about it here and if you also want to host it via GitHub pages, check out this page."

    "text": "We don’t really know where this goes—and I’m not sure we really care.\n\nDuring the 80’s and 90’s there was a popular television show called “the joy of painting” by Bob Ross. If you have not heard about the show, you have almost certainly seen some of the internet memes.\nThe videos of Bob Ross are entertaining and relaxing, Bob’s light-hearted approach to painting and his approach to learning something new is something we as programming should adapt.\nBob’s painting tutorials were never really advanced – the shows are typically 30 minutes of him casually walking through some landscape painting.\n\nWe don’t make mistakes, just happy little accidents.\n\nThe approach to learning programming is often that it should be directly applicable to work and needs to be something new. Why would you ever re-write a program that already exist? In a certain sense, there is no need to re-write a program that you can already use.\nThere is an inherent joy in writing a program. Sometimes you have some extra time and stumble upon a small issue in computing. One could spend a few minutes to find a program that does what you want. An alternative is to try to write a very simple custom-built program to solve your small issue. The idea is not to publish this program – this is only something you do for yourself.\n\nWe artists are a different breed of people. We’re a happy bunch."
