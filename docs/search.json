    "text": "Why would anyone start a blog in 2023?\nTechnical writing is difficult, and is something I want to improve at, which is why I’m starting a blog to practice my technical writing. I plan to share some of my personal project and stuff I learn from those projects on this blog, which I created with Quarto.\nQuarto is a very cool scientific typesetting system built to share technical content and share via, for example, a website such as this one. I built this website using Quarto as a personal project to learn more about how it works and to improve my web development skills. If you’re interested in how this website was created, I host it in a GitHub repository and publish it via GitHub pages. If you’re interested in creating a blog using Quarto, you can learn more about it here and if you also want to host it via GitHub pages, check out this page."
