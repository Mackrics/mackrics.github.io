  <title>I’m starting a blog</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>Why would anyone start a blog in 2023?</p>
<p>Technical writing is difficult, and is something I want to improve at, which is why I’m starting a blog to practice my technical writing. I plan to share some of my personal project and stuff I learn from those projects on this blog, which I created with <a href="https://quarto.org">Quarto</a>.</p>
<p>Quarto is a very cool scientific typesetting system built to share technical content and share via, for example, a website such as this one. I built this website using Quarto as a personal project to learn more about how it works and to improve my web development skills. If you’re interested in how this website was created, I host it in a <a href="https://github.com/Mackrics/mackrics.github.io">GitHub repository</a> and publish it via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>. If you’re interested in creating a blog using Quarto, you can learn more about it <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html">here</a> and if you also want to host it via GitHub pages, check out <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html">this page</a>.</p>
