  <title>The joy of programming</title>

<p>We don’t really know where this goes—and I’m not sure we really care.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the 80’s and 90’s there was a popular television show called “the joy of painting” by Bob Ross. If you have not heard about the show, you have almost certainly seen some of the internet memes.</p>
<p>The videos of Bob Ross are entertaining and relaxing, Bob’s light-hearted approach to painting and his approach to learning something new is something we as programming should adapt.</p>
<p>Bob’s painting tutorials were never really advanced – the shows are typically 30 minutes of him casually walking through some landscape painting.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We don’t make mistakes, just happy little accidents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The approach to learning programming is often that it should be directly applicable to work and needs to be something new. Why would you ever re-write a program that already exist? In a certain sense, there is no need to re-write a program that you can already use.</p>
<p>There is an inherent joy in writing a program. Sometimes you have some extra time and stumble upon a small issue in computing. One could spend a few minutes to find a program that does what you want. An alternative is to try to write a very simple custom-built program to solve your small issue. The idea is not to publish this program – this is only something you do for yourself.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We artists are a different breed of people. We’re a happy bunch.</p>

  <title>I’m starting a blog</title>
  <link>https://mackrics.com/blog/starting-blog.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>Why would anyone start a blog in 2023?</p>
<p>Technical writing is difficult, and is something I want to improve at, which is why I’m starting a blog to practice my technical writing. I plan to share some of my personal project and stuff I learn from those projects on this blog, which I created with <a href="https://quarto.org">Quarto</a>.</p>
<p>Quarto is a very cool scientific typesetting system built to share technical content and share via, for example, a website such as this one. I built this website using Quarto as a personal project to learn more about how it works and to improve my web development skills. If you’re interested in how this website was created, I host it in a <a href="https://github.com/Mackrics/mackrics.github.io">GitHub repository</a> and publish it via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>. If you’re interested in creating a blog using Quarto, you can learn more about it <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html">here</a> and if you also want to host it via GitHub pages, check out <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html">this page</a>.</p>
